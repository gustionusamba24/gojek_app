I used the design from Arif Iskandar, and thanks for him for providing a beautiful design that I can use to learn how to create a UI like Gojek App.

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have installed Flutter. If you are not, visit this link [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Make sure you have installed Android Studio or XCode to run the emulator. If you are not, visit this link [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
3. You can download your favorite IDE such as Android Studio, VSCode, or Intellij IDEA. If you are not, visit this link [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). I prefer use Intellij IDEA because it's more lightweight than Android Studio and it's support Flutter very well.
